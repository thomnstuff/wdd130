           <p>Hello fellow adventurers! If you are like me, when you hit the trail, 
            you sometimes are greeted with that ominous thought that creeps in, “did 
            I forget something important!?!”. There have been several occasions where 
            that thought has creeped in far too late, forcing me to have to travel, 
            often, several miles back to the car in shame, ruining the adventurous 
            experience I intended on having. All of this could have been avoided if I 
            had a means to organize better. This is the purpose of this website. To act 
            as your gear check list, making sure you don’t mistakenly leave anything you 
            need behind. The wilderness can be a very dangerous place, especially when 
            you are not properly prepared with the right equipment. </p>

           <p>Another purpose of this site is to organize the right gear for the right 
            occasion. If you are like me, summer isn’t the only season you hit the 
            trails, nor alpine forests are the only environments you frequent. The 
            gear we bring would have to adjust to whatever the season or environment 
            demands, and that means that you’ll have to bring the right gear for the 
            right situation. When the temperature drops down to a frigged low, did you 
            accidently forget to switch out the lighter jacket you normally bring with 
            the heavier down jacket? This can indeed lead to either a very unpleasant 
            experience (I know from experience), or potential death! I should add that 
            in order for my original idea to work (allowing a user to organize their own 
            gear set-ups on the site), I’ll have to include some JavaScript, which I don’t 
            think we’re including in this course. So, I’ve simplified my idea by including 
            the three different organized set-ups I use for the three different 
            circumstances I usually encounter (each set-up will have a link to its own page).</p>
