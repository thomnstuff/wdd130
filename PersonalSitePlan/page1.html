                Desert Gear: As a southern Californian, I’m surrounded by numerous hiking opportunities. 
                Whether that’s the Los Padres national Forest, Angeles National Forest, San Bernardino 
                National Forest, or even some parts of Inyo National Forest, these environments require 
                specific gear (things that allow for making extra room for extra water). Because you’re 
                often not dealing with cold temperatures, there’s little need to bring the heavier warm 
                items, as you wouldn’t want to bring more than you need to. So, this set up will include 
                the lighter items of my available options. Click here to see my set up for desert adventures.

                Alpine Gear/Glacier Lake Gear: A good part of being a Californian is learning about the 
                majesty of the High Sierras (for me personally, I’ve mainly encountered the eastern side 
                of the Sierra-Nevadas). For this environment, you’ll likely be climbing thousands of feet 
                over treacherous rocky passes to get to the absolutely beautiful glacier lake sceneries. 
                So, making sure you don’t bring more than you need to would be a nice thing to do for your 
                poor legs. Also, most of the wilderness areas in the Sierras require that you bring items 
                like Bear Cans, so adjusting what to bring is a must. Also, it would be a crying shame to 
                hike all those thousands of feet to a beautiful glacier lake and not go fishing for trout, 
                so this gear set up will, of course, include fly fishing gear.
