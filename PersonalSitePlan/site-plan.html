      <p>
        Hello fellow adventurers! If you are like me, when you hit the trail, you sometimes are greeted
        with that ominous thought that creeps in, “did I forget something important!?!”. There have been 
        several occasions where that thought has creeped in far too late, forcing me to have to travel,  
        often, several miles back to the car in shame, ruining the adventurous experience I intended on 
        having. All of this could have been avoided if I had a means to organize better. This is the purpose 
        of this website. To act as your gear check list, making sure you don’t mistakenly leave anything you 
        need behind. The wilderness can be a very dangerous place, especially when you are not properly prepared 
        with the right equipment. 

        Another purpose of this site is to organize the right gear for the right occasion. If you are like me, summer
        isn’t the only season you hit the trails, nor alpine forests are the only environments you frequent. The gear 
        we bring would have to adjust to whatever the season or environment demands, and that means that you’ll have 
        to bring the right gear for the right situation. When the temperature drops down to a frigged low, did you 
        accidently forget to switch out the lighter jacket you normally bring with the heavier down jacket? This can 
        indeed lead to either a very unpleasant experience (I know from experience), or potential death!
        I should add that in order for my original idea to work (allowing a user to organize their own gear set-ups on the site), I’ll 
        have to include some JavaScript, which I don’t think we’re including in this course. So, I’ve simplified my 
        idea by including the three different organized set-ups I use for the three different circumstances I usually 
        encounter (each set-up will have a link to its own page).

      <h3>Desert and Alpine Gear</h3>
      <p>
        Desert Gear: As a southern Californian, I’m surrounded by numerous hiking opportunities. 
        Whether that’s the Los Padres national Forest, Angeles National Forest, San Bernardino 
        National Forest, or even some parts of Inyo National Forest, these environments require 
        specific gear (things that allow for making extra room for extra water). Because you’re 
        often not dealing with cold temperatures, there’s little need to bring the heavier warm 
        items, as you wouldn’t want to bring more than you need to. So, this set up will include 
        the lighter items of my available options. Click here to see my set up for desert adventures. 

        Alpine Gear/Glacier Lake Gear: A good part of being a Californian is learning about the 
        majesty of the High Sierras (for me personally, I’ve mainly encountered the eastern side 
        of the Sierra-Nevadas). For this environment, you’ll likely be climbing thousands of feet 
        over treacherous rocky passes to get to the absolutely beautiful glacier lake sceneries. 
        So, making sure you don’t bring more than you need to would be a nice thing to do for your 
        poor legs. Also, most of the wilderness areas in the Sierras require that you bring items 
        like Bear Cans, so adjusting what to bring is a must. Also, it would be a crying shame to 
        hike all those thousands of feet to a beautiful glacier lake and not go fishing for trout, 
        so this gear set up will, of course, include fly fishing gear.

      </ul>
      <h3>Cold Weather Gear</h3>
      <p>
        Fall Alpine/Winter Desert: It’s these times of the season where it’s vital that you bring 
        your warmer/heavier items. Though, I’m including the Bear Can and fishing equipment, these 
        items can be excluded for most of the winter-desert places.
